# **üë©üèª‚Äçüíª** Requirements

During the whole process of the project, there are some requirements that we need to strictly follow in order to complete:

- The system provides an administrator who can access, modify and delete user profiles.
- The user should be able to register, sign in and sign out. After logging in, the user should be able to edit their profile, arrange new appointments for an appropriate doctor around their area based on their health problem and desiring distance. After confirming the appointment, an email will be sent for verification.
- The user should be able to view their booked appointment, then be able to alter or cancel it. There should be a reminder to notify the user before the time. In addition, the patients can export their health information as a pdf/txt file.
- The source code should include the Javadoc file.

# üòé Collaborator

Afterall, this is still a project of a course in our major at Frankfurt University of Applied Sciene. However, during this project we have learnt how to be adaptable and inventive when faced with challenges, especially while learning a new programming language that will serve as a solid foundation for our future endeavors. In my perspective, the main purpouse of this project is not only to satisfy the requirement of the course, but also build a fundamental for the industry business later, especially when it comes to communication, self management and the willingness to learn.

We would like to express my deep appreciation to the faculty of the Frankfurt University of Applied Sciences for their explanation and guidance on how to write technical reports, especially Prof. Luigi La Blunda, the instructor of this project.

I would also like to thank all my friends and classmates for their support and suggestions during the process of completing the project:
